# itunes-library-compare

Compares my iTunes library to Cindy's for consolidation.  This has to be done
because my phone upgraded to ios 10.x and my computer could not upgrade
iTunes. So now my poor Macbook is stuck and I can't sync my phone.

So, I'll import all the unique files in my library and then sync my phone
with Cindy's computer, which is newer. I'm still working on a mid 2007
laptop. But that's better than the PPC Mac Mini, which is right to my
right.

This is the first time I used c9.io for primary development.  I got almost
all done, but just had to cloce the repository on my laptop to do the final
copy of the files. Worked pretty good.
